# ECE385 CA Documentation

Online website with SystemVerilog and design testing documentation written by CAs.

**For CAs with CPanel access**: simply run the deploy script from the main project directory (after cloning) to build and deploy the website to remote. However, ensure that you have the appropriate ssh configuration set up before attempting to do so - ask anyone who you know has pushed to this website before to check that you've done it correctly.
