# ECE385 CA Documentation

Online website with SystemVerilog and design testing documentation written by CAs.

## Submitting PRs with new content

Content on the website is written as markdown files stored in the content/docs folder. Creating a file in there should immediately be reflected in the local build with `hugo server`.

## Updating the Hosted Website

**For CAs with CPanel access**: simply run the deploy script from the main project directory (after cloning) to build and deploy the website to remote. However, ensure that you have the appropriate ssh configuration set up before attempting to do so - ask anyone who you know has pushed to this website before to check that you've done it correctly.
