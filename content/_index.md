# ECE 385 CA Documentation and Resources

This is a resource that is constantly being updated and revised. As such, there **_may be mistakes in these pages_**. If something you do after using it here isn't working, please make a cursory google search to crosscheck whatever it is you did before flagging down a CA.

## Why does this exist?

Until now, the main way that students have learned SystemVerilog and verification skills has been through some lecture slides and using the LRM. By creating a centralized resource, we hope to reduce the number of times you have to ask "hey, where'd this snippet come from?".

## Who made this?

As the header implies, this website was made solely by current/past ECE 385 CAs on their own time. If you'd like to help contribute to this resource, feel free to submit pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/pradyungn/ece385-systemverilog-docs).
