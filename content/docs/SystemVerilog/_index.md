# SystemVerilog Docs

This section of documentation (and its sub-articles) detail how to use the SystemVerilog language to describe hardware designs. While most of the content in this section is directly paralleled by the content covered in lecture, there are some additional features of SV covered that _are not necessary to get through ECE385_, but are good to know! They can certainly be used in the course to make your HDL more concise.

The rest of this page will, at a high level, introduce you to the SystemVerilog language. The other subpages visible in the left-hand menu will detail specific operators or features of the SystemVerilog language - we've done our best to organize these features in the order that you'll need them in class!
